"""Put a new H.264 stream into a .pmf without disturbing the container.

The film is a program stream of 2048-byte packs, one PES packet each. All of
it -- pack headers and their SCR, the video PES headers and every PTS in them,
the ATRAC3+ packs, the system headers, the padding, the file length -- is kept
byte for byte. Only the coded pixels change.

Getting that right on a real PSP means more than a valid stream. The Media
Engine checks the mux buffer model: a frame's SCR (when the pack arrives) and
its PTS (when it is shown) have to keep the spacing the disc shipped with, or
its fixed video buffer overruns and the hardware faults. PPSSPP grows its
buffers to fit and never notices, which is what makes this easy to get wrong.

So each re-encoded frame is byte-ALIGNED to the offset its counterpart had in
the original elementary stream, and the gaps are filled with zero bytes --
leading_zero_8bits ahead of the next start code, which Annex-B allows anywhere
and every decoder skips. Filler NALs would do the same job on paper but the ME
rejects them. The aligned stream is exactly the original's length, so it drops
straight into the original payload slots and every PES header still describes
what follows it.

Approach and the buffer-model reasoning follow snake759494/vc2-korean-patch,
which worked this out on real hardware for Valkyria Chronicles 2.
